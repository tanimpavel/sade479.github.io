                <li>Repetition - Each part of the website as your scroll down uses vector images acompanied with text showing reptition.</li>

            <h3><a href="http://www.pnwx.com/" target="_blank">Pnwx.com</a></h3>
            <p>This is the website of Pacific Northwest X-ray selling various X-ray related equipment.</p>
            <ul class="centerlist">
                <li>Contrast - The lack of contrast with the dark background combined with dark text makes it difficult to read. Modifying the colors with either light on dark or dark on light would greatly improve this. </li>
                <li>Repetition - Each of the product pages uses a different layout lacking any repetition. Using the same layout of each product would improve this.</li>
                <li>Alignment - There is some basic alignment with different products falling under differnet headers but it can be improved with more consistent product layouts.</li>
                <li>Proximity - The website does a fair job with proximity as it is easy to identify different parts of the website but can be improved with better placement of product images.</li>
