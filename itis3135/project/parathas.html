        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                To make the dough, place the flour into a mixing bowl. Gradually stir in 1/4 cup vegetable 
                oil and the water to make a soft, pliable dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface 
                and knead until smooth, about 4 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover, and set aside for 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 1/2 cup of vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Sprinkle in the mustard seeds; when the seeds 
                start to pop, stir in the green chile, ginger, onions, and curry leaves. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the 
                onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the turmeric and a pinch of salt and cook for 1 minute more. 
                Mix in the prawns and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is 
                no longer transparent in the center, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a cast iron skillet or heavy frying pan over medium heat. Brush the skillet with oil or use cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir the beaten eggs into the prawn filling mixture. Place a circle of dough into the preheated skillet. 
                Spread 3 tablespoons of filling over the dough. Cook until the bottom of the bread has browned, about 5 minutes. 
                Lower the heat and carefully turn the paratha over with a spatula. Cook for an additional 5 minutes so the 
                prawn mixture is well stuck to the paratha. Flip the paratha over again and transfer it to a cutting board.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll the paratha into a cylinder shape to enclose the filling. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. 
                Cut each stuffed paratha in half to serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
