        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan; bring to a boil. 
                Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined. Slowly mix in 
                butter and yogurt until dough comes together. Let gulab dough rest for 5 minutes. 
                Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Test the temperature 
                of the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough. When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 
                1 minute before coming to the surface, the oil is ready.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully, until dark golden brown on all sides, 
                about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining gulab.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab. Remove from heat and let them soak 
                in the syrup, covered, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
            </li>
        </ol>
