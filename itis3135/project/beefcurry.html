        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, 
                about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and 
                dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the garlic, green chiles, ginger paste, cardamom seeds, cloves, and cinnamon sticks. 
                Cook and stir until the garlic begins to brown, 3 to 5 more minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix cumin, coriander, turmeric, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and water into the onion mixture. 
                Simmer until most of the water has evaporated and the mixture has thickened.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in beef chuck pieces until coated with spice mixture; simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, 
                until the beef is cooked through and tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
            </li>
        </ol>
